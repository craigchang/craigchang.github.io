Worked with 2 other members in a group project to design and construct an autonomous race car that could navigate through a preset course in the shortest time possible. The course was marked by 1-inch-wide reflective white tape on dark and non-reflective carpet. In order to produce an optimally fast and accurate car, the following specifications were made:

* Optimized track sensing circuits using an optical sensor.
* Optimized speed and steering control circuits using a DMOS switching circuit and implemented PID control (proportional-integral-derivative) for closed-loop feedback.

Software/Hardware Used:

* Keil uVision4 IDE for software development
* TI Stellaris LM3S6982 Microcontroller
* Parallax TSL1401-DB Linescan Optical Sensor
* Fubata S3010 analog servo
