The [NATCAR Design Project](http://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/natcar/) was created by UC Davis and National Semiconductor, and sponsored by Texas Instruments. Collaborated with 2 group members to design and construct an autonomous race car that could navigate through a preset track in the shortest time possible. The race track was marked by 1-inch-wide white tape, as well as a 100 mA current underneath the tape.
