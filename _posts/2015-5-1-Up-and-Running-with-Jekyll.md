The site is currently built and maintained using [Jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is a powerful blog-aware, static site generator that allows users to create pure static websites. It is simple to use, easily configurable, and very lightweight. The library also supports many features such as Disqus for commenting, and plugins for more customizable generated content. The site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), which also provides support for Jekyll-generated web content.
